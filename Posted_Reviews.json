      "ReviewBody": "The first and only album from +44, starts off rather strong with _Lycanthrope_. The Energy of this song tells you that that you are in for a classic pop punk album, and it continues for a couple songs until you remember that half of the band is [Blink-182](../../Blink-182/Blink-182_Artist_Review.md) and their last album was [Blink-182](../../Blink-182/Blink-182/Blink-182_Album_Review.md)... The album drops off after _When your Heart Stops Beating_ moving into the more slow, experimental nature that is featured on _Blink-182_. The songs _Little Death_ and _No It Isn't_ are both about the breakup of _Blink-182_, while _Little Death_ isn't a bad song by any means it can start to drag a bit on repeat listens. _No It Isn't_ on the other hand is fantastic build from the more experimental tracks back to the higher energy the album started with. _Make You Smile_ is the absolute best song on the album, the duet nature makes this song an absolute joy.\n\nOverall I think the album is a solid mix of pre-breakup _Blink-182_ and a new evolution of pop punk. The album starts high then dips, but on the oathg the end starts to ramp, in my opinion, higher than the start. Sometimes the more experimental nature feels to drag, but overall I think the album is a solid 3 out of 5",

      "ReviewBody": "Justice, I haven't thought about this band or this album in years, coming back to it though it doesn't really hold the same place for me. The album starts out with _Genesis_ its a nice buildup, telling you what to expect for the next 48 minutes, but feels as though it takes a bit too long to get to its point, this was a tough one since I do like it with the album as a whole but I don't think it holds up on its own merits. _Let There Be Light_ has some interesting charactists, but the extended distorted organ starts to wear thing fairly quickly. The transition between the previous and the next track, _D.A.N.C.E_ is also a little wonky. The radio changing effect between songs is always a little jarring for me, but I guess its not a bad way to transiiton from a slower song to a classic pop bop. Probably the only actual song people know off this album, it is quite the fun dance track bringing in funk elements with a classic 4 on the flour house beat. I do n the whole enjoy this song, but it can be a bit saccharine at times.\nNext up is _Newjack_ and while it does fit with the ascethitic of the album; the consistant high pass filters make it a fairly annoying listen on its own. _Phantom_ is a bit on the noise-y side, which I typically like, but it felt almost a little Jam-y which is not quite what the rest of the album feels like. What else needs to be said about _Phantom Part II_ that hasn't been covered by _Phantom_, it is just a continuation of the previous track and really should just be combined. _Valentine_ is a nice palette cleanser from the previous blocks of tracks. I feel its needed, but the song on its own is not really that great.\nThis album so far might sound like a big miss rather than a nice trip down memory lane, that is until it hits with the next block of tracks, starting with _TThhee PPaarrttyy_. I have mixed feelings about this song, it is quite a great buildup to the next block of tracks, but as a solo play it doesn't really hold its own. _DVNO_ on the other hand, is a straight up jam. Such a fun bop, it almost jumped itself up a whole place. I know what I said about the previous noise-y, jam-y track, but _Stress_ owns it. It almost has a sythwave vibe, even though this album is about 15 years to young for that genre. _Waters Of Nazareth_ continues on the trend of the previous track, but picks up the pace a bit. The ending few tracks of this album are really what solidify the entire albums rating. Finally _One Minute to Midnight_ closes the album out, a nice respite from the last few tracks. Would be a lot higher if it didn't do that stupid minute of dead space at the end.\nOverall I do enjoy the album but it is on the low end of 3 out of 5. The strength of the last half of the album really carries it higher.",

The ablum starts to really pick up with _Time Bomb_, its got that catchy chorus that breaks right into that classic ska breakdown. _Olympia WA_ has that shredding solo to prove that they can do more than just power chords. You can really feel the punk roots showing in _Lock, Step & Gone_, sounds just like a Clash song turned just a little more modern. And the titular track of the album, _Junkie Man_, even though the title is just part of of the outro of the song. _Listed M.I.A._ brings home how different, yet the same every track on this album is. I am definitely showing my bias towards loud, fast, punk music here. _Ruby Soho_ The best track on the album, even though Punk isn't supposed to be chorus heavy, Ska is on the other hand. So far this also marks the first 5 star song rating I have given out, hopefully got some more coming. The next few songs: _Daily City Train_, _Journey to the End of East Bay_, and _She's Automatic_; are all not bad songs, but nothing worth really pointing out. _Old Friend_ really starts to brings back the classic ska stroke.  _Disorder and Disarray_ Is in my opinion the last hurrah of this album, everything after is still good but nothing super memorable.\n\nOverall this has been my favorite album of the relisten so far. This album hits every chord for a fun, ska-punk, album should. This album is definitely going back into heavy rotation.",

So while I do enjoy this album, it is not something I could see myself really listening to all that often. The Album does start strong with a nice long build on _Sol_, then kind of chills out and meanders a while for tracks like _Circles of Motion_ and _Discovering_. _The Stones are not too Busy_ starts to pick it back up over its 10 minute duration, but then again starts to chill out again. I have a hard time of coming up with new things to say about an ambient track, becuase you aren't really supposed to _Listen_ to them, so much as they are supposed to be background noise to help you focus or put you in a mood. Its the same way with a lot of Post rock for me as well. _Das Bungalow_ is pulling me back in, I like a bit of up-tempo with my ambient. I could very easily see this album being the OST for a space puzzle game. Its got that nice open sound while still holding you in the moment, it has a nice air-y breath-y sound qualities as well.",

The way they bend progressive tendancies with metal is jaw dropping. The opening track, _Vicarious_, has this awesome slow build until it gets into the song proper. I think a lot of people just associate Tool with the people who like Tool, instead of necassarily appreciating the music for what it is. The album meanders a bit for a few tracks, it has an interesting build with _Wings For Marie_ but the payoff in _10,000 Days_ isn't quite enough for me. The Everything changes when we get to the song _The Pot_ this song is fantastic, and the first Tool song I ever heard. remember how I said everything was changing, that was wishful thinking. The next two tracks _Lipan Conjuring_ and _Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)_, are just noise/intermission tracks. Have I ever mentioned how much I hate when artists do this. HOOO BOYYY. Next up is _Rosetta Stoned_, eleven minutes and eleven seconds of pure jam, if it was shorter it might get the coveted five out of five. The album keeps doing this flip flop of really solid tracks with just noise, it would be different if the noise tracks led into the others, but they seem to be there just to be there. _Right in Two_ brings the album back right into that groove. The last track on the album, _Viginti Tres_, is another just noise track.\n\nI really like the album overall, but the noise tracks really hamper it from being a fantastic album.",

It starts out pretty space-y with _We Are All Made of Stars_ but slowely transitions to another just boring slow track _The Great Escape_. After this track the album starts to build up again until it gets to _Extreme Ways_ this was the Bourne trilogy theme song and what initially got me into Moby, and its followed up with _Jam for the Ladies_ which I really like but doesn't fit the theme of the album at all. Unfortunately after this the album really drops off for me. If it wasn't for the two songs I mentioned above this album would be a solid 2, but with those additions it just barely eeks out a 3.",

This album is a mix of finding a groove and then leaving the groove when it starts to get boring. The titular track, _1983_, is a build on the groove, it takes its time to find it and then slowely builds and adds new elements to it over the course of its duration. The complex beat structure with the glitch like fill; makes for a very interesting listen. As soon as you think you understand the tracks, you find something new to enjoy. _Babble_, while not a bad track, I feel is just too short and doesn't really accomplish what it sets out to. One of my few issues with the album is some of the transistions are a little too hard. _Unexpected Delight_ really lives up to its name. The volicity of the backing track makes combined with the haunting vocals by Laura; make for a hypnotic track that doesn't let go of your attention.",

What is a misnomer on this album is the songs I gave a 2 star too. While I enjoyed all these tracks I feel like on a shuffle I would most likely skip them. But this album is fuzzy, warm, and a great jam album. Every track gets you in a groove and then just holds you there until it decides its time to move on. _Short Fuse_ is very reminiscient of a [The Hives](../../Hives,%20TheHives_Artist_Review.md) track, but a little more on the lo-fi side. _Meltdown_, the hidden track on the album (based MusicBee filters out the minutes of silence), would have been a lot lower if I couldn't have filterd the white noise out.",

The song _Edge of the Earth_ is the first track that makes me realize that this album is something special. They managed to make the sound very open, while still keeping that heaviness associated with metal. _Fallen_ really amps up on the space theme. For a first showing from 30 Seconds to Mars, this is a great showing. While not as much to talk about since the album fits the theme it sets pretty well.

Listening through you can tell the obvious influences with _Murder City_ being something off of [The Black Parade](../../My%20Chemical%20Romance/The%20Black%20Parade/The_Black_Parade_Album_Review.md). Off the same album _21st Century Breakdown_ feels like it wants to be that bombastic anthem that _Welcome to the Black Parade_ is. _Know Your Enemy_ is reminiscient of some of their own earlier work, like something off of [Warning](../Warning/Warning_Album_Review.md). Even the next track _Viva La Gloria!_ sounds familair to their older work, specifically [American Idiot](../American%20Idiot/American_Idiot_Album_Review.md). Skipping a bit ahead _Last of the American Girls_ sounds like the intro song to a mid 2000s teen girl movie. _Restless Heart Syndrome_, even though it has such a ripping solo, it just takes too long to get anywhere that I don't find myself wanting to wait to get to the good part. _Horseshoes and Handgrenades_ feels like a straight rip off of [The Hives](../../Hives,%20The/The_Hives_Artist_Review.md).\n\tThis is the second album by Green Day that is supposed to be a \"Punk Rock Opera\", the first being _American Idiot_, but this album feels a bit disengenous to me. Maybe I am being too harsh on this album; if you think it about it another way this album came out at the end of the decade so maybe they were just trying to highlight the previous decades punk, emo, and emo anthems into a rock opera. To me though I think it feels more like they are apeing the sounds they are trying to pay homage too.",

Seeing as this album was called Volume 1 I was kind of assuming there would be a volume 2 but I have not read anything about a potential volume 2 anywhere. Each track on this album is a cover, redone in the signature stye of Streetlight Manifesto. The covers are, in order: Mason Jennings, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Radiohead, Bad Religion, The Dead Milkmen, NOFX, Paul Simon, Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution, Paul Simon, Luis Jordan, and The Postal Service. The Cover of the Bad Religion song will be really interesting to compare to the orignal since I have that track in the library somehwere. What's really interesting about this album is they do a good job of making the covers sound different, but they still have the soul of the original. I think the cover/pairing that does this the best is Hurt by NIN that was covered by Johnny Cash. The song Just, even without knowing that it was a Radiohead song, you can still hear the chord progressions and the fill they tend to use on their songs bleed through the cover as well. What really drew me to this album was their cover of The Postal Service's Such Great Heights, there are thousands, I mean, thousands of covers of this song, but Streetlight actually managed to do the track in a different style so it feels different and unique but you can still see the soul. We've been having a great streak with the strong reviews, let's hope that trend continues.",

Samurai Champloo always had a fantastic soundtrack, blending a more traditional Japanese sound with the modern, at the time, hip hop sound. Unfortunately I am missing a few tracks on this album, but with my reception to the other tracks, I am not sure if they would have helped the score on this review overall. What gets me about this album is that I like the beats behind the tracks, but its one of the guys in the group has a really grating sound to me and they seem to feature him in every single song. This album also does the classic hip hop thing of including a ton of sample tracks or skits, which hurt this album overall in my opinion. Then you get to the track _San Francisco_ and it all comes back, the groovey nature of the track just puts you in a good mood. It might just be my initial bias towards the show, but this track would have made a fantastic closing track. Well here ends the streak of strong reviews, I have a few tracks that I will keep in mind going forward, but overall I think this album will stay buried in the library.",

While the first album from 30STM was a more progressive metal sound, this album seem to forgo both the metal and progressive stint from that album and move distinctly into the alternative realm; probably where the money is at compared to progressive and metal. The singles still definitely hold up, albeit not quite as high as I remember, but they were still very good. What this album does carry over from their first, is the spacey quality. The tracks sound very open, or airy, and that mixed with some of the oppressive riffs, really do a good job of setting the scene. Even though this album moves more into that alternative realm, in some ways its almost more ambitious than the first album. But with that ambition not every lands. So while not a fantastic album, still a pretty good one. This also marks the end of the **number/symbol** albums and we are now in the **A** territory.",

      "ReviewBody": "A concept well shown is happening within this album. Each track is titled a year aka the title, the year is important here because that is when the sampled tracks were created. So basically this album is a showcase of specific samples how you can create something new with the old. This album generally starts off a little on the droning side for me, it has an unnecassary talking track to start it off, and then builds into a cosntant rising action to kind of set the tone for whats to come. But other than that the start of the album is rather slow. It does start to pick up after the halfway point with some tracks that will definitely be making it a more heavy rotation. The sole reason I bought this album years ago, was for _'64 aka Go_, this track has a groovey, mystical kind of quality to it. It feels as though you are on a quest traveling through the Desert. It might also not be instantly noticable, but the vocal sample is from William Shatner.",

      "ReviewBody": "Oh Depeche Mode, the originators of synth pop as we know it and you can definitely see the origins here. The ablum starts out on a bit of a slow note with _Leave in Silence_, but it slowely builds throughout the track, not to some grand crescendo, but definitely enough to keep your interest throughout. The energy stays at that mellow, yet still dancy level in the next track _My Secret Garden_. _Monument_ starts out with this intrigueing beat to start off with. At this point I was starting to lose a bit of interest after multiple listens, feeling that there was something missing from the composition. Then _See You_ comes on, and picks up the pace by quite a lot. _Satallite_ almost feels like an electronic reggea song, its got the skanking bum-pause-bum-bum thing going one (there's got to be a better way to describe that). _The Meaning of Love_ is just a classic, right up there with _Just Can't Get Enough_. Now the following track _Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden_ is rather interesting, it almost feels like a part 2 instead of a revisit of the main song. It really takes the melancholy this album has been brewing and takes it one notch darker instead. Its also interesting that it wasn't placed after the song is revisiting. Overall the album does a great job of being *A Mood*, but sometimes it leaves a little to be desired, even though its a solid album all around.",

      "ReviewBody": "A classic album. I think I wore the cd out when I was in middle/high school. That first sharp intake of breath on _Creature_ always gets me in a mood. This album is full of angst, from the vocals to the guitars, to every fiber of every song. Even back when I first started listening to this album; I usually really dislike the more melodic-chanting type of chorus; I fell in love with choruses, they act as a nice break from the more heavy screaming centric verses. I think with _The Theft_, being the standout single from this album, always fell a bit short for me. I think the magic of the melodic/hardcore mashup didn't really work as well with this track as it has done with other tracks. Now _Ex's and Oh's_ on the other hand, what a catchy track. Everything about that track gets me absolutely pumped up. The song _My Fork in the Road..._ even though it got a three has a sick guitar solo that is defintiely worth checking out. Over all the album is just a bunhc of nostalgia for me, I still like it, but I don't know if I would like it as much if I didn't love it so much as a kid.",

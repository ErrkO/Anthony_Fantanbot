      "Artist": "+44",
      "ReviewBody": "The first and only album from +44, starts off rather strong with _Lycanthrope_. The Energy of this song tells you that that you are in for a classic pop punk album, and it continues for a couple songs until you remember that half of the band is [Blink-182](../../Blink-182/Blink-182_Artist_Review.md) and their last album was [Blink-182](../../Blink-182/Blink-182/Blink-182_Album_Review.md)... The album drops off after _When your Heart Stops Beating_ moving into the more slow, experimental nature that is featured on _Blink-182_. The songs _Little Death_ and _No It Isn't_ are both about the breakup of _Blink-182_, while _Little Death_ isn't a bad song by any means it can start to drag a bit on repeat listens. _No It Isn't_ on the other hand is fantastic build from the more experimental tracks back to the higher energy the album started with. _Make You Smile_ is the absolute best song on the album, the duet nature makes this song an absolute joy.\n\nOverall I think the album is a solid mix of pre-breakup _Blink-182_ and a new evolution of pop punk. The album starts high then dips, but on the oathg the end starts to ramp, in my opinion, higher than the start. Sometimes the more experimental nature feels to drag, but overall I think the album is a solid 3 out of 5",

      "ReviewBody": "Justice, I haven't thought about this band or this album in years, coming back to it though it doesn't really hold the same place for me. The album starts out with _Genesis_ its a nice buildup, telling you what to expect for the next 48 minutes, but feels as though it takes a bit too long to get to its point, this was a tough one since I do like it with the album as a whole but I don't think it holds up on its own merits. _Let There Be Light_ has some interesting charactists, but the extended distorted organ starts to wear thing fairly quickly. The transition between the previous and the next track, _D.A.N.C.E_ is also a little wonky. The radio changing effect between songs is always a little jarring for me, but I guess its not a bad way to transiiton from a slower song to a classic pop bop. Probably the only actual song people know off this album, it is quite the fun dance track bringing in funk elements with a classic 4 on the flour house beat. I do n the whole enjoy this song, but it can be a bit saccharine at times.\nNext up is _Newjack_ and while it does fit with the ascethitic of the album; the consistant high pass filters make it a fairly annoying listen on its own. _Phantom_ is a bit on the noise-y side, which I typically like, but it felt almost a little Jam-y which is not quite what the rest of the album feels like. What else needs to be said about _Phantom Part II_ that hasn't been covered by _Phantom_, it is just a continuation of the previous track and really should just be combined. _Valentine_ is a nice palette cleanser from the previous blocks of tracks. I feel its needed, but the song on its own is not really that great.\nThis album so far might sound like a big miss rather than a nice trip down memory lane, that is until it hits with the next block of tracks, starting with _TThhee PPaarrttyy_. I have mixed feelings about this song, it is quite a great buildup to the next block of tracks, but as a solo play it doesn't really hold its own. _DVNO_ on the other hand, is a straight up jam. Such a fun bop, it almost jumped itself up a whole place. I know what I said about the previous noise-y, jam-y track, but _Stress_ owns it. It almost has a sythwave vibe, even though this album is about 15 years to young for that genre. _Waters Of Nazareth_ continues on the trend of the previous track, but picks up the pace a bit. The ending few tracks of this album are really what solidify the entire albums rating. Finally _One Minute to Midnight_ closes the album out, a nice respite from the last few tracks. Would be a lot higher if it didn't do that stupid minute of dead space at the end.\nOverall I do enjoy the album but it is on the low end of 3 out of 5. The strength of the last half of the album really carries it higher.",

The ablum starts to really pick up with _Time Bomb_, its got that catchy chorus that breaks right into that classic ska breakdown. _Olympia WA_ has that shredding solo to prove that they can do more than just power chords. You can really feel the punk roots showing in _Lock, Step & Gone_, sounds just like a Clash song turned just a little more modern. And the titular track of the album, _Junkie Man_, even though the title is just part of of the outro of the song. _Listed M.I.A._ brings home how different, yet the same every track on this album is. I am definitely showing my bias towards loud, fast, punk music here. _Ruby Soho_ The best track on the album, even though Punk isn't supposed to be chorus heavy, Ska is on the other hand. So far this also marks the first 5 star song rating I have given out, hopefully got some more coming. The next few songs: _Daily City Train_, _Journey to the End of East Bay_, and _She's Automatic_; are all not bad songs, but nothing worth really pointing out. _Old Friend_ really starts to brings back the classic ska stroke.  _Disorder and Disarray_ Is in my opinion the last hurrah of this album, everything after is still good but nothing super memorable.\n\nOverall this has been my favorite album of the relisten so far. This album hits every chord for a fun, ska-punk, album should. This album is definitely going back into heavy rotation.",

So while I do enjoy this album, it is not something I could see myself really listening to all that often. The Album does start strong with a nice long build on _Sol_, then kind of chills out and meanders a while for tracks like _Circles of Motion_ and _Discovering_. _The Stones are not too Busy_ starts to pick it back up over its 10 minute duration, but then again starts to chill out again. I have a hard time of coming up with new things to say about an ambient track, becuase you aren't really supposed to _Listen_ to them, so much as they are supposed to be background noise to help you focus or put you in a mood. Its the same way with a lot of Post rock for me as well. _Das Bungalow_ is pulling me back in, I like a bit of up-tempo with my ambient. I could very easily see this album being the OST for a space puzzle game. Its got that nice open sound while still holding you in the moment, it has a nice air-y breath-y sound qualities as well.",

The way they bend progressive tendancies with metal is jaw dropping. The opening track, _Vicarious_, has this awesome slow build until it gets into the song proper. I think a lot of people just associate Tool with the people who like Tool, instead of necassarily appreciating the music for what it is. The album meanders a bit for a few tracks, it has an interesting build with _Wings For Marie_ but the payoff in _10,000 Days_ isn't quite enough for me. The Everything changes when we get to the song _The Pot_ this song is fantastic, and the first Tool song I ever heard. remember how I said everything was changing, that was wishful thinking. The next two tracks _Lipan Conjuring_ and _Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)_, are just noise/intermission tracks. Have I ever mentioned how much I hate when artists do this. HOOO BOYYY. Next up is _Rosetta Stoned_, eleven minutes and eleven seconds of pure jam, if it was shorter it might get the coveted five out of five. The album keeps doing this flip flop of really solid tracks with just noise, it would be different if the noise tracks led into the others, but they seem to be there just to be there. _Right in Two_ brings the album back right into that groove. The last track on the album, _Viginti Tres_, is another just noise track.\n\nI really like the album overall, but the noise tracks really hamper it from being a fantastic album.",

Nice mix of catchy but also in your face.

This album really shows the musicianship of the group, it starts off with power chord after power chord, but then it evolves over the course of the album and you can see those roots and then see how it grows past them.",

I seemed to alternate every track, with either liking it or hating it. _Coffee & TV_ was surprising hit on the album for me, but apart from that it was pretty touch and go. _Optigan 1_ was your standard noise interlude, which I hate, and then _Tender_, seven minutes of a boring slow song, no thank you. Overall I didn't hate this album, but I didn't really find anything special in it that I really liked.",

This album feels very swing-y too me; in the sense that it swings from good to bad throughout the album. It starts out pretty space-y with _We Are All Made of Stars_ but slowely transitions to another just boring slow track _The Great Escape_. After this track the album starts to build up again until it gets to _Extreme Ways_ this was the Bourne trilogy theme song and what initially got me into Moby, and its followed up with _Jam for the Ladies_ which I really like but doesn't fit the theme of the album at all. Unfortunately after this the album really drops off for me. If it wasn't for the two songs I mentioned above this album would be a solid 2, but with those additions it just barely eeks out a 3.",

This album is a mix of finding a groove and then leaving the groove when it starts to get boring. The titular track, _1983_, is a build on the groove, it takes its time to find it and then slowely builds and adds new elements to it over the course of its duration. The complex beat structure with the glitch like fill; makes for a very interesting listen. As soon as you think you understand the tracks, you find something new to enjoy. _Babble_, while not a bad track, I feel is just too short and doesn't really accomplish what it sets out to. One of my few issues with the album is some of the transistions are a little too hard. _Unexpected Delight_ really lives up to its name. The volicity of the backing track makes combined with the haunting vocals by Laura; make for a hypnotic track that doesn't let go of your attention.",

But this album is fuzzy, warm, and a great jam album. Every track gets you in a groove and then just holds you there until it decides its time to move on. _Short Fuse_ is very reminiscient of a [The Hives](../../Hives,%20TheHives_Artist_Review.md) track, but a little more on the lo-fi side. _Meltdown_, the hidden track on the album (based MusicBee filters out the minutes of silence), would have been a lot lower if I couldn't have filterd the white noise out.",

This album on the other hand has much more of a progressive blend to its sound than I remember of the next album. The song _Edge of the Earth_ is the first track that makes me realize that this album is something special. They managed to make the sound very open, while still keeping that heaviness associated with metal. _Fallen_ really amps up on the space theme. For a first showing from 30 Seconds to Mars, this is a great showing. While not as much to talk about since the album fits the theme it sets pretty well. Overall this album is fantastic and is definitely going back into the rotation.",

Listening through you can tell the obvious influences with _Murder City_ being something off of [The Black Parade](../../My%20Chemical%20Romance/The%20Black%20Parade/The_Black_Parade_Album_Review.md). Off the same album _21st Century Breakdown_ feels like it wants to be that bombastic anthem that _Welcome to the Black Parade_ is. _Know Your Enemy_ is reminiscient of some of their own earlier work, like something off of [Warning](../Warning/Warning_Album_Review.md). Even the next track _Viva La Gloria!_ sounds familair to their older work, specifically [American Idiot](../American%20Idiot/American_Idiot_Album_Review.md). Skipping a bit ahead _Last of the American Girls_ sounds like the intro song to a mid 2000s teen girl movie. _Restless Heart Syndrome_, even though it has such a ripping solo, it just takes too long to get anywhere that I don't find myself wanting to wait to get to the good part. _Horseshoes and Handgrenades_ feels like a straight rip off of [The Hives](../../Hives,%20The/The_Hives_Artist_Review.md).\n\tThis is the second album by Green Day that is supposed to be a \"Punk Rock Opera\", the first being _American Idiot_, but this album feels a bit disengenous to me. Maybe I am being too harsh on this album; if you think it about it another way this album came out at the end of the decade so maybe they were just trying to highlight the previous decades punk, emo, and emo anthems into a rock opera. To me though I think it feels more like they are apeing the sounds they are trying to pay homage too.",

Seeing as this album was called Volume 1 I was kind of assuming there would be a volume 2 but I have not read anything about a potential volume 2 anywhere. Each track on this album is a cover, redone in the signature stye of Streetlight Manifesto. The covers are, in order: Mason Jennings, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Radiohead, Bad Religion, The Dead Milkmen, NOFX, Paul Simon, Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution, Paul Simon, Luis Jordan, and The Postal Service. The Cover of the Bad Religion song will be really interesting to compare to the orignal since I have that track in the library somehwere. What's really interesting about this album is they do a good job of making the covers sound different, but they still have the soul of the original. I think the cover/pairing that does this the best is Hurt by NIN that was covered by Johnny Cash. The song Just, even without knowing that it was a Radiohead song, you can still hear the chord progressions and the fill they tend to use on their songs bleed through the cover as well. What really drew me to this album was their cover of The Postal Service's Such Great Heights, there are thousands, I mean, thousands of covers of this song, but Streetlight actually managed to do the track in a different style so it feels different and unique but you can still see the soul. We've been having a great streak with the strong reviews, let's hope that trend continues.",

      "ReviewBody": "So I was initally very interested in this album since Midicronica did the end track for Samurai Champloo. Samurai Champloo always had a fantastic soundtrack, blending a more traditional Japanese sound with the modern, at the time, hip hop sound. Unfortunately I am missing a few tracks on this album, but with my reception to the other tracks, I am not sure if they would have helped the score on this review overall. What gets me about this album is that I like the beats behind the tracks, but its one of the guys in the group has a really grating sound to me and they seem to feature him in every single song. This album also does the classic hip hop thing of including a ton of sample tracks or skits, which hurt this album overall in my opinion. Then you get to the track _San Francisco_ and it all comes back, the groovey nature of the track just puts you in a good mood. It might just be my initial bias towards the show, but this track would have made a fantastic closing track. Well here ends the streak of strong reviews, I have a few tracks that I will keep in mind going forward, but overall I think this album will stay buried in the library.",

The songs _The Kill_ and _From Yesterday_ were all over the radio when this album came out, like you couldn't escape them at all. While the first album from 30STM was a more progressive metal sound, this album seem to forgo both the metal and progressive stint from that album and move distinctly into the alternative realm; probably where the money is at compared to progressive and metal. The singles still definitely hold up, albeit not quite as high as I remember, but they were still very good. What this album does carry over from their first, is the spacey quality. The tracks sound very open, or airy, and that mixed with some of the oppressive riffs, really do a good job of setting the scene. Even though this album moves more into that alternative realm, in some ways its almost more ambitious than the first album. But with that ambition not every lands. So while not a fantastic album, still a pretty good one. This also marks the end of the **number/symbol** albums and we are now in the **A** territory.",

So basically this album is a showcase of specific samples how you can create something new with the old. This album generally starts off a little on the droning side for me, it has an unnecassary talking track to start it off, and then builds into a cosntant rising action to kind of set the tone for whats to come. But other than that the start of the album is rather slow. It does start to pick up after the halfway point with some tracks that will definitely be making it a more heavy rotation. The sole reason I bought this album years ago, was for _'64 aka Go_, this track has a groovey, mystical kind of quality to it. It feels as though you are on a quest traveling through the Desert. It might also not be instantly noticable, but the vocal sample is from William Shatner.",

The ablum starts out on a bit of a slow note with _Leave in Silence_, but it slowely builds throughout the track, not to some grand crescendo, but definitely enough to keep your interest throughout. The energy stays at that mellow, yet still dancy level in the next track _My Secret Garden_. _Monument_ starts out with this intrigueing beat to start off with. At this point I was starting to lose a bit of interest after multiple listens, feeling that there was something missing from the composition. Then _See You_ comes on, and picks up the pace by quite a lot. _Satallite_ almost feels like an electronic reggea song, its got the skanking bum-pause-bum-bum thing going one (there's got to be a better way to describe that). _The Meaning of Love_ is just a classic, right up there with _Just Can't Get Enough_. Now the following track _Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden_ is rather interesting, it almost feels like a part 2 instead of a revisit of the main song. It really takes the melancholy this album has been brewing and takes it one notch darker instead. Its also interesting that it wasn't placed after the song is revisiting. Overall the album does a great job of being *A Mood*, but sometimes it leaves a little to be desired, even though its a solid album all around.",

This album is full of angst, from the vocals to the guitars, to every fiber of every song. Even back when I first started listening to this album; I usually really dislike the more melodic-chanting type of chorus; I fell in love with choruses, they act as a nice break from the more heavy screaming centric verses. I think with _The Theft_, being the standout single from this album, always fell a bit short for me. I think the magic of the melodic/hardcore mashup didn't really work as well with this track as it has done with other tracks. Now _Ex's and Oh's_ on the other hand, what a catchy track. Everything about that track gets me absolutely pumped up. The song _My Fork in the Road..._ even though it got a three has a sick guitar solo that is defintiely worth checking out. Over all the album is just a bunhc of nostalgia for me, I still like it, but I don't know if I would like it as much if I didn't love it so much as a kid.",

      "ReviewBody": "Oh The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, a ska classic. I don't think I had ever actually listened to this album all the way through before. It definitely has that early 2000's feel to it, got some slightly pop-punkier vibes than some of their earlier work. The album starts out strong with _A Jackknight to a Swan_. _Mr. Moran_ opens with a sample from some old movie or something, and I don't know why but I am always a sucker for those. _You Gotta Go!_ is: \"Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up!\" the song. The ablum definitely sllows down quite a bit with _Everybody's Better_. This song defintely has a kind of rocksteady vibe to it. The next two tracks, _Sugar Free_ and _I Want My City Back_, both take it back up to the ska punk that you would expect of the Bosstones. Nothing really much to say, they are solid tracks but don't really change, or mix anything up. I will say the mix of the ska punk sound with the rocksteady vibes does do a good job of breaking the album the album. I personally am not such a big fan of the rocksteady but it is nice in small doses. The opening of _The Old School Off the Bright_ starts out as kind of a bepop beat, I wish it stuck with it a bit longer before transitioning into the punk banger. _The Punch Line_ is definetly one of the highs of this album, just a classic Bosstones track. The Organ on _Shit Outta Luck_ is always a highlight for me, I don't know what it is about that organ sound but I can't get enough of it. Overall this album is a ska classic, it doesn't really do anything special but its by no means bad.",

The album definitely starts out strong, but really comes into it's own during the titular track. You can definitely see the roots of some of their most popular tracks beginning to take hold here. _Ave Maria_ my favorite track off the album, it has this nostalgic quality to it. _Coal City Blues_ just drops the pace of the album, I know its basically a requirment for punk bands to have atleast one or two slow songs but they are always my least favorite on the album. The next track, _Keychain_, brings us right back to the action. that first line always gets me hyped \"I feel my teeth turning black...\". _Even for an Eggshell_ is rather interesting as well, its a song about Hamlet, and its a really cool take. _Richard Coury_ is the second of like four slow tracks on this album, this songs saving grace is that it gets really good about halfway through. _Straight to Hell_ has got the early markings of _I don't want to be an Asshole Anymore_ written all over it. _Cold Weather Gear_ is really just a sample over some acoustic strumming, there is some actual track in here but its doewsn't have enough going on for me. The last hurrah of the album, _Clap Hands Two Guns_, tries to get us back to the highs of the earlier portion of the album, but with a harder edge to it. Overall this album is fantastic, it has a few rough spots which should probably drop it to a three, but I think the highs are worth the jump to a four.",

I believe this is more about the fact that the song is really fucking oitherwise. I think the track _GOT MY PONY SPAM FOR YOU_ would have easiliy jumped to a 4 if it didn't have such a long intro about hand farts. Besides the talking portions this album is a fast paced gem. _WHO'S READY FOR THE BASEMENT_ has quite the littany of samples throughout, it's almost a game in and of itself to try and pick out all the samples. The track _VS PSYCHOLOGY_ which is a stevie wonder cover, has this really cool spooky, ambient sound to it. The next few tracks are good, but you c an defitely see their unfinished nature. Everything starts to pick back up for me when _YOU GOT CURVES, SHE GOT CURVES_ starts playing. The final track, _DARK TONY HAWK IS BORN_ is the gem on this album. It is such a great track, featuring a sample from Adventure Time of Marceline singing about her father. Overall its a solid little mixtape featuring some uncut/unfinished work but I think the pieces themselves are good enough hold their own.",

      "ReviewBody": "We have another rock opera style album. This is a post-hardcore edition with the premise focusing on Dante's inferno. The album starts out, _The Dark Wood of Error_, with a lilting melody featuring a duet between the male and female singers. Almost haunting in a way, it really sets the mood for the rest of the album. The first actual track of the album is, _A Forbidden Dance_, they definitely toned down the screaming for this album, its still there for sure, but just not as often as some previous albums. I'm changing my opinion on _Hand in Hand with the Damned_ this track fucking rocks. The build up for the next track, _Beyond the Sacred Glass_ is mindblowing as well. The guitar solo pretty much makes this song. The next track _The Temptress_ has this chorus that I cannot stand in this kind of genre, thats the reason for the low star rating. Another stand out is _Circle VII: Sins of the Lion_, the chorus on this song just gets me so hyped up. The next Track _Vestige_ is a nice break from the hardcore sound, although I think the instrumental version is better. _Lullaby of the Crucified_ marks a fantastic end to Act One, being a rock opera this album is broken up into two eight song acts. After a bit of a lull, _Lybyrinth_ brings us right back to the action. The hardcore screaming a nice compliment to some of the softer elements. After _Welcome to the Vanity Faire_ the album starts to shift towards a more carnival-esque sound, there has to be a better descriptor than that. Overall this is another great album, I think this might be my favorite Alesana album period.",

I think this is one of those albums that you can play anywhere and people will get into it. This is one of those albums thats hard to get into specifics with, since all the tracks feel the same, but are distinctly different. But tracks like _Reservations_ are really a standout. It's such a groovey track. _30 Gallon Tank_ is just rising action the song. All the songs on the album are just fun songs. We see things slowing down a bit when we get to _Metal Detektor_. I actually changed my mind on _June's Foreign Spell_ while listening to it for the review. That song is actually a four and not a three.

The album does start out a little rough for me with _Contre Le Sexisme_, being mostly a silence/noise track. Things start picking up with _Sunday_, definitely harkens a lot to the 90s indie sound but does a nice job of not feeling too repetitive. When the bridge kicks back up towards the middle of _Wildflower Soul_ I feel it. I think this album definitely has some high highs, but also some low lows. I guess that is one of the issues with Art Rock, you can find some really cool sounds but you can never really stick with them for too long. Most of the songs do a nice job of jumping between a softer side and then a harder edgier side. Overall I think the album has some good pieces, but I don't think it will make it as an everyday staple.",

This is still on the more lofi-gargey side before they moved in a more progressive route for their later albums. The first track _Dead Man's Gun_ definitely sets the stage, it's nice and jammy with sick solo right in the middle. _Ticklish Warrior_ carries the momentum and kind of adds a Wall of Sound type ascetic. The next track _Jammed Entrance_ is this albums jam track. It's a good jam, but nothing special as well. _Plastic Plant_ kicks everything into overdrive. That guitar riff at the beginning just makes you want to mosh. _Gelatinous Cube_ keeps that energy high, I think I just like loud and fast guitars, which is waht this album is mostly. The album generall slows down quite a bit after that last track. _Unwrap the Friend, Pt.2_ is another jam track, still fun but more carries the energy rather than build it up or down. The jamming continues with _Crawl Out From the Fall Out_; it's more of a noise-y thing than a jammy track, but about halfway through it starts to get a bit more instrumental. Finally _The Axis_ almost has a religious quality to it. Feels like the end of an acid trip when your ramblings are starting to sound prophetic. The organ defintely helps in that regard. Overall I think this is a fucking fantastic album, not for everyone but for a fan of Dwyer or Oh Sees its a must listen.",

We slow things down a bit when move to _inside out star tree_ and amp up the glitchiness when we get to _end of ice_. I really like _end of ice_ but I wish it would go someplace instead of just building a mood. THe track _animal crossing_ has this really interesting eastern sound to it. I really can't decide if _animal crossing_ or _she spoke of it_ are my favorites but defintiely two standouts of the album.

The song is basically all rising action. The drum and base is strong with _Not So Bad_, it starts out a little slow for my taste but it definitely picks up the action. The next two tracks _You Goddamn Fish_ and _Way High_ are both a little on the slow side for me. _Physicallity_ is a really interesting track that uses a System of a Down sample. Really fun track.

The first few tracks _I Hate Children_, _Who Is Who?_, _Wrecking Ball_, and _L.A. Girl_ are all great tracks, a little on the samesies side for most of them. They all feature that fast as a whip thrash sound. The album startes to really pick up for me during _Kids of the Black Hole_. The sound changes up a bit, its quite a bit longer at five and half minutes versus the one and half minute tracks preceding it. The slow build of the track, that leads into that solo is really something else, not something you were seeing out of a ton of punk bands at the time. _No Way_ starts out with that guitar solo to really bring the energy back up in preperation for the next track. _Amoeba_ is the track that got them famous. The track so good a record store named themselves after it. Such a catchy jam, I don't know a person that couldn't get it into. When you say thrash punk, you think Amoeba. Skipping a few tracks, _Democracy_ turns out to be really timeless, the same sentiments exist fourty years after this album came out. _No Friends_ is the next track on the list. This song got a four strictly for that solo towards the end. _Creatures_ has this energy, another fun track. Overall this album is one of the greatest, a little on the samesies side to warrent a five, but this is definitely going in heavy rotation",

You also might notice that there is a thousand different symbols, this is what broke the bot a while ago. Starting off the first track is literally a second long, seriously why do artists do this stuff, it's not like there is a track quota on albums. For the most part this album is _fine_, nothing special and nothing terrible. That being said there are two tracks in particular that are really good. _THE DEMONS_ has this really interesting sample, presumadly from a televangelist, that plays throughout it. The followup up track _[Rush Coil]_, is also worth noting here. The mix of an organ with a trap beat is something I never knew I needed before now. Other than those two, the other tracks aren't bad, just nothing else worth saying. Overall it's a fun album that is definitely worth a listen.",

For the most part this album is pretty chill, whith some fun upticks. _Cat Tail Lake_ is very much like that, the first half is pretty chill and ambient, but then it morphs into this bouncy jam track. It eventually leads to the track, _Wasn't All There_, which I do like, in parts. I usually kind of like the effect of the radio static, as if you are changing stations; but it's used to such an extent that it actually does the opposite for me here. Then we get to _Tweesee Smiled_ and what a track to go out on. It's got some heavy Dnb vibes, that breaks down into like a vgm guitar riff. After that transition it becomes an airy, trance song. Overall I don't think I like this album that much, but there are a few tracks that definitely make it worth while.",

The first two tracks _To Shiela_ and _Ava Adore_ are a little on the art house style for me, a little too slow as well. _Perfect_ is more inline with what I would expect from Smashing pumpkins. Then in _Daphne Descends_ it goes back to that moody electronic sound. The next series of tracks, aren't bad just a little on the boring side. This album feels very 90's at points, thats not necassarily a bad thing but it can be. The track _Appels + Oranjes_ leans very heavily into the electronic sound, almost going full on Moby Electronic. _Pug_ stays on the electronic bend that the previous track sets up, but is a lot more high enegery. _Annie-Dog_ starts out as a slow piano driven dirge, but slowely builds and builds over the course of its run time. Overall I don't think this album is bad, its just not really for me. The few standouts are the only thing holding this album at a three for me.",

The first track, _Bored_, is my favorite on the album, has a really nice chorus running through it. _One Weak_ is another track that has a pretty good chorus, not good enough to bump it up, but still pretty good. Some of the bass grooves on this album, are absolutely fantastic though. The next few tracks, _Nosebleed_ and _Lifter_, both are pretty overtly aggro tracks. _Lifter_ in particular does have a really good rising action through out it. _Root_ has a nice riff to as well. There isn't really a ton to say about most of these songs, they are all pretty samey. Which is not unexpected from a band like Deftones, especially in their early state. They do slow things down a bit in songs like, _Birthmark_ or _Fireal_, defintely when I think their sound gets real interesting. Overall I think this is a good enough showing from deftones but their later albums are definitely way better.",

      "ReviewBody": "I think I've really only listened to the singles off this album. For whatever reason, they decided to cut the last minute or two off of one of their jam tracks and make it into a seperate track. Maybe it was to increase the track count but it drives me crazy. Now there are like five \"songs\" that have the potential to end up in a shuffle that is just noise. If those tracks were really necassary to the album then just keep them apart of the longer songs so they are \"unskippable\". Now back to the actual review. _Stinkfist_ starts off the album pretty strong. Definitely sets a good mood, with that mysterious sounding riff mixed with the bongos. _Eulogy_ keeps up the air of mystique that is prevalent throughout this album. The song doesn't really start picking up until about halfway through it's eight minute run time. Most of these songs are just shifting and changing the mood from a heady slow jam, into the more aggro metal portions. _H._ is definitely one of those tracks. The track _Hooker with a Penis_ kind of solidies this band as the frat band it kind of is. _Pushit_ is another one of the singles that I've heard before, this is definitely one of their better songs. While it is another slow build over its almost ten minute runtime, what's interesting is the call back to previous verses as it builds up. So it will go chorus, build, chorus, build a bit faster, so on and so forth. Now we get to the tracks that I really liked. _AEnema_ and _Third Eye_. Even though I called tool a frat band earlier, they are also very much hippy-ish as well, if you couldn't tell by the obvious drug references everywhere. Overall the album is good, it would be better without those five noise tracks, but I definitely think there is something to enjoy here.",

We start the album with _Dark Snow_, a nice brooding track that has a nice energy to carry it through. It almost has a new wave kind of quality to it as well. The next track _Still a Stranger_ has this acoustic guitar opening that I don't know how to place, but it always reminds me of anything kind of gothy like the self titled Blink-182 album. It does then immediately break down into a much faster riff structure. This song almost has a REM kind of vibe to it as well. _Hidden Knives_ has such a sick chorus on it. _So Beneath You_ is easily one of the best tracks on the album. _Dumb Kids_ is another really standout song to me. When it breaks into that \"Heeeeeyyyyyyyyy....\" part, gives me goosebumps. Such a fast fun track, very remiscent of some of their other fun tracks from Crash Love. _Pink Eyes_ on the other hand, has a chorus that kind of makes me groan a bit. _Feed From the Floor_ is the last track that I especially like, the rest of the tracks aren't bad, just not amazing. This album really feels like a love child between emo and new wave, I think _Feed From the Floor_ really accents that. Overall for being the second full length AFI album that I have listened to all the way through, it's really good. Kind of gets a bit too poppy in certain segments for me, but the songs that land; land fucking hard.",

Sithu Aye describes himself as happy progressive genre, that definitely seems to track, although I would argue its more straight progressive myself. The first song on the ep is _Mandalay_. As the song hits it's climax, it gets into this really powerful solo. One of the things I really like about his music, is that it really feels like its taking you on a journey. The titular track _26_, almost has a post-hardcore vibe to it, feels almost like a solo medley from _Dance Gavin Dance_ or similar band. Overall a fantastic ep, currently one of my favs.",

I very much like this album, but I think for the first half of the album it does sound a bit samey. I did look up the lyrics and it seems as that is the much more important part on this album, but as I don't really listen to lyrics that does kind of hamper the album a bit. _21st Century Digital Boy_ on the other hand, is a classic. also one of the longest songs on the album at two minutes and fifty seconds. To me, this song is one of **The** songs I think of when I think of punk music. It's almost on the too melodic side to even be punk.

I think I might have listned to one of the tracks on this ep before hand and then just written the entire thing off. It's a little on the indie side for my tastes now-a-days but I still generally enjoy this ep. _Airbag_ starts off the album, this is one of those songs that I feel like to really enjoy it, you need to be really high. The next track, _Pearly_ picks up the pace slightly, it's a bit more jammy than the previous track as well. This is a quick review, I mean the ep is only seven songs after all. Overall I think this ep is good, I don't know how the rest of radiohead is going to go though.",

      "ReviewBody": "Now I've been really looking forward to this album and the followup as well. This album and the following all concept albums, 4 eps split into 2 albums covering the four basic elements; Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. This first album takes the elements of fire and water. The fire is symbolized by their former style of \"post-hardcore\" and water is symbolized by an ambient kind of electronica. The second track on the album, _The Messenger_, starts out with this beat that sounds like the \"Showcase\" splash screen music, the thing before _Trailer Park Boys_. _The Arsonist_ has this really sick breakdown, \"I Love this city, enough that I'll set it ablaze\" over and over as the music builds, makes for a really cool effect. The first half is definitely my personal favorite of all 4 eps, but as you'll read in the next review, there are definitely some really cool tracks in the other elements, I just think fire is the most consistant. The second half of this album, Water, is interesting. I can't really say that I've heard Thrice do much with electronic elements before. The ambient electronic sound definitely works to make this sound very ocean-y. Too bad ambient music can be very hard to listen to if you are not in the mood for it. I don't have much to say for the second half; It's not bad, it just doesn't quite hold my interest like the first part does. Overall I think this is a good album, definitely the better of the two, but it doesn't feel like an album that you play all the time more listen to a couple times and think \"Yeah this is a cool concept\" and then don't touch it anymore.",

      "ReviewBody": "The second of the Thrice element concept albums. This album features Air and Earth, Atmospheric and Folk. What's really tough about these albums is that I think the highs are much higher than album one, but the lows are ever so much lower. The opening track _Broken Lungs_ is just this kind of boring ballad that I can barely sit through. Unlike the next track _The Sky Is Falling_ which features this groovy sound and sax chord carrying the melody, this one is a bop. _Daedelus_ is my favorite of all the tracks on both albums, it's a retelling of the myth of Icarus but from his father's perspective. The second half of this album is the Earth portion, based on folk and americana sounding; because those genres are \"down to earth\" get it? While this portion of the album is fine, it's not really my thing, a lot of it feels like the slow portion in a ska album. Overall this half of the two-part album is definitely not my favorite, the highs are high, but other than that it's a snooze fest.",

I can say that sober it definitely holds up as well. The first track _Eonia_ while basically an extended intro for the next track, its still bumping. _Big Thinks Do Remarkable_ is the next track and definitely my favorite on the album. About halfway through when it starts hitting with that \"The Sun, The Sun, The Sun, Is in our eyes\" bit is epic. One of the cool things about ASIWYFA is that each of their albums feel wildly different from eachother, but still the same. This album has a definite upbeat-positive vibe to it. The tracks, _Stay Golden Pt. 1-3_, feel like a giant rising action. _Mend And Make Safe_ has this really cool panflute on the track, I feel like a lot of bands have been using the panflute lately. It also has this glitchy vibe tgo it as well. Since this is the digital deluxe version of this album it does come with two bonus tracks, _Gum_ and _Spiderbox_, both of which are awesome tracks. Overall this album is fantastic and is definitely worth the listen.",

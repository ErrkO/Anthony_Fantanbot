        "ReviewBody": "The first album from Sublime. Who knew they would be such a break out hit after this. The album doesn't feel very cohesive throughout, seeing as the genre shifts each track. This album did a few standouts that I don't think I had listened too before, such as: _We're Only Gonna Die for our Arrogance_, _54-46 That's My Number/Ball and Chain_, and _What Happened_. The mix of sampling on this album is a reall interesting, typically somethign I really enjoy and that holds true here as well. It was fun to relisten to this album and hear some tracks I haven't listened to in years. Although songs like _Badfish_ or _Smoke Two Joints_ have just been played so many times growing up that Idk if I can really listen to them anymore. But this album deserves it's four star rating not much to say other than who hasn't listened to this album and who doesn't think it's good.",

The whole album has a really ancient feel to it, with the chanting and marracas. in some songs it has this nice blend of the progressive with some alternative bent to it. Some songs almost feel like Tool x R.E.M.. _44_ is definitely stronger in the first half then the second half. While I don't have a ton to say about this album, I think it's really good and is definitely worth checking out.",

      "ReviewBody": "A concept well shown is happening within this album. Each track is titled a year aka the title, the year is important here because that is when the sampled tracks were created. So basically this album is a showcase of specific samples how you can create something new with the old. This album generally starts off a little on the droning side for me, it has an unnecassary talking track to start it off, and then builds into a cosntant rising action to kind of set the tone for whats to come. But other than that the start of the album is rather slow. It does start to pick up after the halfway point with some tracks that will definitely be making it a more heavy rotation. The sole reason I bought this album years ago, was for _'64 aka Go_, this track has a groovey, mystical kind of quality to it. It feels as though you are on a quest traveling through the Desert. It might also not be instantly noticable, but the vocal sample is from William Shatner.",

      "ReviewBody": "An Album of Covers, the project was initally started by Bandits of the Acoutstic Revolution. Seeing as this album was called Volume 1 I was kind of assuming there would be a volume 2 but I have not read anything about a potential volume 2 anywhere. Each track on this album is a cover, redone in the signature stye of _Streetlight Manifesto_. The covers are, in order: Mason Jennings, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Radiohead, Bad Religion, The Dead Milkmen, NOFX, Paul Simon, Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution, Paul Simon, Luis Jordan, and The Postal Service. The Cover of the Bad Religion song will be really interesting to compare to the orignal since I have that track in the library somehwere. What's really interesting about this album is they do a good job of making the covers sound different, but they still have the soul of the original. I think the cover/pairing that does this the best is _Hurt_ by NIN that was covered by Johnny Cash. The song _Just_, even without knowing that it was a Radiohead song, you can still hear the chord progressions and the fill they tend to use on their songs bleed through the cover as well. What really drew me to this album was their cover of The Postal Service's _Such Great Heights_, there are thousands, I mean, thousands of covers of this song, but Streetlight actually managed to do the track in a different style so it feels different and unique but you can still see the soul. We've been having a great streak with the strong reviews, let's hope that trend continues.",

      "ReviewBody": "So I was initally very interested in this album since Midicronica did the end track for Samurai Champloo. Samurai Champloo always had a fantastic soundtrack, blending a more traditional Japanese sound with the modern, at the time, hip hop sound. Unfortunately I am missing a few tracks on this album, but with my reception to the other tracks, I am not sure if they would have helped the score on this review overall. What gets me about this album is that I like the beats behind the tracks, but its one of the guys in the group has a really grating sound to me and they seem to feature him in every single song. This album also does the classic hip hop thing of including a ton of sample tracks or skits, which hurt this album overall in my opinion. Then you get to the track _San Francisco_ and it all comes back, the groovey nature of the track just puts you in a good mood. It might just be my initial bias towards the show, but this track would have made a fantastic closing track. Well here ends the streak of strong reviews, I have a few tracks that I will keep in mind going forward, but overall I think this album will stay buried in the library.",

The songs _The Kill_ and _From Yesterday_ were all over the radio when this album came out, like you couldn't escape them at all. While the first album from 30STM was a more progressive metal sound, this album seem to forgo both the metal and progressive stint from that album and move distinctly into the alternative realm; probably where the money is at compared to progressive and metal. The singles still definitely hold up, albeit not quite as high as I remember, but they were still very good. What this album does carry over from their first, is the spacey quality. The tracks sound very open, or airy, and that mixed with some of the oppressive riffs, really do a good job of setting the scene. Even though this album moves more into that alternative realm, in some ways its almost more ambitious than the first album. But with that ambition not every lands. So while not a fantastic album, still a pretty good one. This also marks the end of the **number/symbol** albums and we are now in the **A** territory.",

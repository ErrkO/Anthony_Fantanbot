Then it startup up and my thoughts were \"This is just good edgy music from when I was a teen\". Ignoring the prelude track and the two interludes, this album is a fucking bop. The higher pitch harmonies combined with the heavy-ness of the guitars and screaming compliment each other really well. The album also has this thread of a victorian opera going through it as well, that adds just another layer of depth to the music. The first track that really stands out is _Baby, You Wouldn't Last a Minute on the Creek_. The album also features this weird carnival synth that is layered on some of the tracks. It's such a weird mishmash of moods. This album has been a lost gem for me. Overall this album is great, give it a listen.",

It starts out very pop-y, theres a bit of shoegaze to some of the tracks but for the most part its a little bubblegum-y. There are a few standouts like: _Crystals_ and _Kaleidoscope Hearts_ and a few amazing songs like: _Black Magic_ and _Space_, but for the most part the album is pretty mediocre. Songs like _Treasure_ have this airy 80s sound to them, but they can start to feel very samey pretty quickly. Overall I do like the album, but it feels like it is just one or two albums away from really being something great.",

You can hear some really nuts trumpet solos on some of the songs. For the most part this is pretty bog standard Ska, nothing wrong with that, just nothing special either.

A bunch of the tracks, like _Can This Be_ actaully have quite a bit of introspection to them.

Its one of those albums that you really have to be in the mood for, you can't just listen to it whenever you want. If I could get through this album a third time I think I'd have more to say.

For the most part _about_ is a rather chill affair. _ephemera_ takes a couple minutes to pick up, but when it does, holy shit does it pick up. We ride that high from the last minute or so right into _she spoke of it_; a banger all the way through, I think it's my favorite song on the album overall. We slow things down a bit when move to _inside out star tree_ and amp up the glitchiness when we get to _end of ice_. I really like _end of ice_ but I wish it would go someplace instead of just building a mood. THe track _animal crossing_ has this really interesting eastern sound to it. I really can't decide if _animal crossing_ or _she spoke of it_ are my favorites but defintiely two standouts of the album. Overall I think this is a good entry point for the new fursona, hyi, but I really can't wait to see what happens in their second album.",

Always a good time, I believe Renard is the sample, straight electronic fursona, but I don't remember what Adraen is off the top of my head. _Night Ride_ lives up to its name, this song would make a great addition to a driving game. The song is basically all rising action. The drum and base is strong with _Not So Bad_, it starts out a little slow for my taste but it definitely picks up the action. The next two tracks _You Goddamn Fish_ and _Way High_ are both a little on the slow side for me. _Physicallity_ is a really interesting track that uses a System of a Down sample. Really fun track. Overall the album is a short and fun, sample/jungle get down.",

      "ReviewBody": "The first Album from Adolescents. This is **the** Socal Punk album. One of the greatest of all time. Every track is a fast throwdown that just makes you want to mosh. The first few tracks _I Hate Children_, _Who Is Who?_, _Wrecking Ball_, and _L.A. Girl_ are all great tracks, a little on the samesies side for most of them. They all feature that fast as a whip thrash sound. The album startes to really pick up for me during _Kids of the Black Hole_. The sound changes up a bit, its quite a bit longer at five and half minutes versus the one and half minute tracks preceding it. The slow build of the track, that leads into that solo is really something else, not something you were seeing out of a ton of punk bands at the time. _No Way_ starts out with that guitar solo to really bring the energy back up in preperation for the next track. _Amoeba_ is the track that got them famous. The track so good a record store named themselves after it. Such a catchy jam, I don't know a person that couldn't get it into. When you say thrash punk, you think Amoeba. Skipping a few tracks, _Democracy_ turns out to be really timeless, the same sentiments exist fourty years after this album came out. _No Friends_ is the next track on the list. This song got a four strictly for that solo towards the end. _Creatures_ has this energy, another fun track. Overall this album is one of the greatest, a little on the samesies side to warrent a five, but this is definitely going in heavy rotation",

The first two tracks _To Shiela_ and _Ava Adore_ are a little on the art house style for me, a little too slow as well. _Perfect_ is more inline with what I would expect from Smashing pumpkins. Then in _Daphne Descends_ it goes back to that moody electronic sound. The next series of tracks, aren't bad just a little on the boring side. This album feels very 90's at points, thats not necassarily a bad thing but it can be. The track _Appels + Oranjes_ leans very heavily into the electronic sound, almost going full on Moby Electronic. _Pug_ stays on the electronic bend that the previous track sets up, but is a lot more high enegery. _Annie-Dog_ starts out as a slow piano driven dirge, but slowely builds and builds over the course of its run time. Overall I don't think this album is bad, its just not really for me. The few standouts are the only thing holding this album at a three for me.",

The first track, _Bored_, is my favorite on the album, has a really nice chorus running through it. _One Weak_ is another track that has a pretty good chorus, not good enough to bump it up, but still pretty good. Some of the bass grooves on this album, are absolutely fantastic though. The next few tracks, _Nosebleed_ and _Lifter_, both are pretty overtly aggro tracks. _Lifter_ in particular does have a really good rising action through out it. _Root_ has a nice riff to as well. There isn't really a ton to say about most of these songs, they are all pretty samey. Which is not unexpected from a band like Deftones, especially in their early state. They do slow things down a bit in songs like, _Birthmark_ or _Fireal_, defintely when I think their sound gets real interesting. Overall I think this is a good enough showing from deftones but their later albums are definitely way better.",

      "ReviewBody": "I think I've really only listened to the singles off this album. For whatever reason, they decided to cut the last minute or two off of one of their jam tracks and make it into a seperate track. Maybe it was to increase the track count but it drives me crazy. Now there are like five \"songs\" that have the potential to end up in a shuffle that is just noise. If those tracks were really necassary to the album then just keep them apart of the longer songs so they are \"unskippable\". Now back to the actual review. _Stinkfist_ starts off the album pretty strong. Definitely sets a good mood, with that mysterious sounding riff mixed with the bongos. _Eulogy_ keeps up the air of mystique that is prevalent throughout this album. The song doesn't really start picking up until about halfway through it's eight minute run time. Most of these songs are just shifting and changing the mood from a heady slow jam, into the more aggro metal portions. _H._ is definitely one of those tracks. The track _Hooker with a Penis_ kind of solidies this band as the frat band it kind of is. _Pushit_ is another one of the singles that I've heard before, this is definitely one of their better songs. While it is another slow build over its almost ten minute runtime, what's interesting is the call back to previous verses as it builds up. So it will go chorus, build, chorus, build a bit faster, so on and so forth. Now we get to the tracks that I really liked. _AEnema_ and _Third Eye_. Even though I called tool a frat band earlier, they are also very much hippy-ish as well, if you couldn't tell by the obvious drug references everywhere. Overall the album is good, it would be better without those five noise tracks, but I definitely think there is something to enjoy here.",

      "ReviewBody": "This is the latest album from AFI. You can definitely hear a little bit of DECEMBERUNDERGROUND in the sound, but it does sound evolved in ways too. We start the album with _Dark Snow_, a nice brooding track that has a nice energy to carry it through. It almost has a new wave kind of quality to it as well. The next track _Still a Stranger_ has this acoustic guitar opening that I don't know how to place, but it always reminds me of anything kind of gothy like the self titled Blink-182 album. It does then immediately break down into a much faster riff structure. This song almost has a REM kind of vibe to it as well. _Hidden Knives_ has such a sick chorus on it. _So Beneath You_ is easily one of the best tracks on the album. _Dumb Kids_ is another really standout song to me. When it breaks into that \"Heeeeeyyyyyyyyy....\" part, gives me goosebumps. Such a fast fun track, very remiscent of some of their other fun tracks from Crash Love. _Pink Eyes_ on the other hand, has a chorus that kind of makes me groan a bit. _Feed From the Floor_ is the last track that I especially like, the rest of the tracks aren't bad, just not amazing. This album really feels like a love child between emo and new wave, I think _Feed From the Floor_ really accents that. Overall for being the second full length AFI album that I have listened to all the way through, it's really good. Kind of gets a bit too poppy in certain segments for me, but the songs that land; land fucking hard.",

I very much like this album, but I think for the first half of the album it does sound a bit samey. I did look up the lyrics and it seems as that is the much more important part on this album, but as I don't really listen to lyrics that does kind of hamper the album a bit. _21st Century Digital Boy_ on the other hand, is a classic. also one of the longest songs on the album at two minutes and fifty seconds. To me, this song is one of **The** songs I think of when I think of punk music. It's almost on the too melodic side to even be punk.

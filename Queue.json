      "ReviewBody": "The second full length album by Spoon. Classic indie rock at it's finest. Spoon is unironically the soundtrack to the years 2000-2005 for me. I think this is one of those albums that you can play anywhere and people will get into it. This is one of those albums thats hard to get into specifics with, since all the tracks feel the same, but are distinctly different. But tracks like _Reservations_ are really a standout. It's such a groovey track. _30 Gallon Tank_ is just rising action the song. All the songs on the album are just fun songs. We see things slowing down a bit when we get to _Metal Detektor_. I actually changed my mind on _June's Foreign Spell_ while listening to it for the review. That song is actually a four and not a three. Overall not much to say, but give this album a listen if you get a chance.",

The album does start out a little rough for me with _Contre Le Sexisme_, being mostly a silence/noise track. Things start picking up with _Sunday_, definitely harkens a lot to the 90s indie sound but does a nice job of not feeling too repetitive. When the bridge kicks back up towards the middle of _Wildflower Soul_ I feel it. I think this album definitely has some high highs, but also some low lows. I guess that is one of the issues with Art Rock, you can find some really cool sounds but you can never really stick with them for too long. Most of the songs do a nice job of jumping between a softer side and then a harder edgier side. Overall I think the album has some good pieces, but I don't think it will make it as an everyday staple.",

For the most part _about_ is a rather chill affair. _ephemera_ takes a couple minutes to pick up, but when it does, holy shit does it pick up. We ride that high from the last minute or so right into _she spoke of it_; a banger all the way through, I think it's my favorite song on the album overall. We slow things down a bit when move to _inside out star tree_ and amp up the glitchiness when we get to _end of ice_. I really like _end of ice_ but I wish it would go someplace instead of just building a mood. THe track _animal crossing_ has this really interesting eastern sound to it. I really can't decide if _animal crossing_ or _she spoke of it_ are my favorites but defintiely two standouts of the album. Overall I think this is a good entry point for the new fursona, hyi, but I really can't wait to see what happens in their second album.",

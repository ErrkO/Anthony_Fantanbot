Most of the tracks are pretty good on their own, and without the mention of an ost you wouldn't really know it was one. The album is kind of broken into pieces, the main tracks and level themes; the character themes; the full character themes; and then the dlc characters. You might notice that all of the character theme tracks are given ones, that is only because they are just snippets of the killing spree tracks and like thirty seconds long. Overall the album is pretty good, and will probably get a bit of play time in the future.",

I don't think I ever really listened to too much of it, in fact I know I have never listened to this album before. This album is a bit different from what I was expecting. I was expecting grunge-y _Even Flow_ kind of Pearl Jam, not mid 00's alternative rock. The track _The Fixer_, at least in the beginning, sounds like it could be a Hives song. The album starts out pretty strong as well, but around the halfway point it just slows way down and starts to become just unbearable. Overall only listen to the first 4 songs and then skip everything else.",
